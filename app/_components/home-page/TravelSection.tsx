        Traveling is a{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">huge part of my life</span>,
        and I feel lucky to have explored so many different parts of the world.
        It&apos;s something I plan to keep doing for as long as I can! They say
        travel broadens the mind, and I couldn&apos;t agree moreâ€”every trip has
        taught me something new about life that I wouldn&apos;t have learned
        otherwise. So far, I&apos;ve visited{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">29 countries</span> and{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">
          6 out of the 7 continents
        </span>
        , and I&apos;m always excited for the next adventure.

        When I&apos;m not coding, you can usually find me out skateboarding or
        at the gym,{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">I love staying active</span>{" "}
        and being outdoors as much as possible. On days when I&apos;m too sore
        to be active, I&apos;m also known to grow different types of chilli and
        strange varities vegetables, my rule is if I can buy it in the shops, im
        not growing it! My girlfriend and I also enjoy{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">cooking together</span>, my
        specialty dish is a Caribbean goat curry.
