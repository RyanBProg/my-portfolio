        Traveling is a{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">huge part of my life</span>,
        and I feel lucky to have explored so many different parts of the world.
        It's something I plan to keep doing for as long as I can! They say
        travel broadens the mind, and I couldn't agree moreâ€”every trip has
        taught me something new about life that I wouldn't have learned
        otherwise. So far, I've visited{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">29 countries</span> and{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">
          6 out of the 7 continents
        </span>
        , and I'm always excited for the next adventure.

        When I'm not coding, you can usually find me out skateboarding or at the
        gym,{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">I love staying active</span>{" "}
        and being outdoors as much as possible. On days when I'm too sore to be
        active, I'm also known to grow different types of chilli and strange
        varities vegetables, my rule is if I can buy it in the shops, im not
        growing it! My girlfriend and I also enjoy{" "}
        <span className="text-white font-semibold">cooking together</span>, my
        specialty dish is a Caribbean goat curry.
